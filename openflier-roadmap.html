        In this article, we will give a brief introduction to OpenFlier, and what we would like to achive before Sep.
        2023.

        <h2>What is OpenFlier</h2>
        OpenFlier is a successor to Zyflier. It is also the open source version of Zyflier.
        <h2>Why OpenFlier</h2>
        OpenFlier is designed to be open source, extensible and easy to maintain. By exposing more underlying
        interfaces and options to the user, it can be quickly modified to be compatible with the lastest version of
        Cloudsnote. Also, being open source means that we can get support from more people.

        <h2>Roadmap</h2> 
        <h3>Stage 1: Implement basic features</h3>
        - UDP server, FTP server, MQTT server<br>
        - Connection & Validation<br>

        <h3>Stage 2: Implement screenshot features</h3>
        This stage will be the most important stage. We will rewrite most of the code to ensure stability.<br>
        - Basic screenshots<br>
        - SpecialChannels<br>

        <h3>Stage 3: Implement Configurator</h3>
        We will combine Zyflier and EzyConfigurator together in OpenFlier to support configuration hot reload.<br>
        Also, we will be storing configuration in Json format.<br>

        <h3>Stage 4: Implement extension features</h3>
        By using an extensible architecture, OpenFlier will enable more developers to join in the development.
